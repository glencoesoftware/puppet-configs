Hiera
=====

Heira is a data storage layer with puppet integration.  It is used to abstract 
data from manifest configuration.  Things like email addresses, usernames, ntp
servers can all be stored in various hiera backends in order to keep that 
information separate from the manifest code.

As currently configured there are 2 hiera backends, yaml and puppet.
